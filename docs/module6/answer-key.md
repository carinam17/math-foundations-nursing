## Quick Reference — Unit Cancellation Reminders

!!! tip "Setting Up Any Problem"
    1. Write what you **have**
    2. Write what you **want**
    3. Build the chain so unwanted units cancel
    4. Check which unit remains before calculating
    5. Calculate and round appropriately
    6. Ask — is this a reasonable answer?

!!! info "Key Conversions to Memorize"
    | Conversion | Value |
    |---|---|
    | 1 kg | 2.2 lb |
    | 1 g | 1000 mg |
    | 1 mg | 1000 mcg |
    | 1 L | 1000 mL |
    | 1 tsp | 5 mL |
    | 1 tbsp | 15 mL |
    | 1 fl oz | 30 mL |
    | 1 hr | 60 min |

!!! info "Key Formulas"
    | Calculation | Formula |
    |---|---|
    | Flow rate | Volume ÷ Time (hr) |
    | Infusion time | Volume ÷ Rate |
    | Volume infused | Rate × Time |
    | Drip rate | (Volume ÷ Time in min) × Drop factor |
    | Drip rate from rate | (mL/hr × Drop factor) ÷ 60 |
    | Microdrip shortcut | gtt/min = mL/hr |
    | Dose verification | Rate × Concentration |
