# Module 1 - Basic Arithmetic Review

## Overview

This module reviews the core arithmetic skills that underpin 
every nursing calculation you will encounter in clinical practice. 
Before calculating a drug dose or an IV flow rate, you need 
to be confident with the fundamentals covered here.

Work through each topic in order — each one builds on the last.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module you should be able to:

- Perform operations with whole numbers, fractions, and decimals
- Round numbers correctly to the required decimal place
- Calculate percentages
- Recognize and apply patient safety rules around decimal notation
- Apply these skills to basic clinical scenarios

## Topics

| Topic | Key Skills |
|---|---|
| [Whole Numbers](whole-numbers.md) | Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division |
| [Fractions](fractions.md) | Simplifying, multiplying, dividing, adding |
| [Decimals](decimals.md) | Operations, comparing, leading and trailing zeros |
| [Rounding](rounding.md) | Nearest whole, tenth, hundredth — nursing standards |
| [Percentages](percentages.md) | Converting, calculating, IV concentrations |

## Estimated Time

Approximately 1-2 hours including practice problems.

## Clinical Relevance

!!! info "Why This Matters"
    Every dosage calculation in this course reduces to 
    basic arithmetic at the final step. A rounding error, 
    a misplaced decimal point, or a percentage miscalculation 
    can result in a patient receiving the wrong dose.
    
    These are not abstract math skills — they are 
    patient safety skills.

!!! tip "Before You Begin"
    Have a pen and paper ready. Attempt every practice 
    problem by hand before checking the answer. 
    Writing out each step builds the habit of showing 
    your work — which is expected in clinical practice 
    and on competency exams.

!!! warning "Patient Safety — Decimal Notation"
    Two rules you must know before any medication calculation:
    
    - Always write a **leading zero** — **0.5 mg** not **.5 mg**
    - Never write a **trailing zero** — **5 mg** not **5.0 mg**
    
    These rules exist because misread decimals are a leading 
    cause of medication errors. They will be reinforced 
    throughout this course.
