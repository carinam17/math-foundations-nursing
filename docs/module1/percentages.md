# Percentages

## What Is a Percentage?

A percentage represents a part of 100. The word "percent" 
literally means "per hundred."

\[25\% = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\]

In nursing, percentages appear in IV solution concentrations, 
oxygen saturation, body surface area calculations, and more.

## Converting Between Forms

### Percentage to Decimal
Divide by 100 (or move decimal point two places left):

\[45\% = 45 \div 100 = 0.45\]
\[0.9\% = 0.9 \div 100 = 0.009\]

### Decimal to Percentage
Multiply by 100 (or move decimal point two places right):

\[0.25 \times 100 = 25\%\]
\[0.009 \times 100 = 0.9\%\]

### Percentage to Fraction
Place the percentage over 100 and simplify:

\[25\% = \frac{25}{100} = \frac{1}{4}\]

### Fraction to Percentage
Divide numerator by denominator then multiply by 100:

\[\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \times 100 = 25\%\]

## Finding a Percentage of a Number

Multiply the number by the decimal form of the percentage:

\[20\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100\]

## Clinical Application

!!! info "IV Solution Concentrations"
    IV solutions are labeled by percentage concentration, meaning 
    grams of solute per 100 mL of solution.

**Example:**
Normal saline is labeled **0.9% NaCl**. This means:

\[0.9 \text{ g of NaCl per } 100 \text{ mL of solution}\]

**Example:**
Dextrose 5% in water (D5W) means:

\[5 \text{ g of dextrose per } 100 \text{ mL of solution}\]

**Example:**
A patient's oxygen saturation is 98%. Express this as a decimal:

\[98\% = 0.98\]

## Practice Problems

!!! example "Problem 1"
    Convert 35% to a decimal.

??? success "Answer"
    \[35\% = 35 \div 100 = 0.35\]

!!! example "Problem 2"
    Convert 0.45 to a percentage.

??? success "Answer"
    \[0.45 \times 100 = 45\%\]

!!! example "Problem 3"
    What is 15% of 200?

??? success "Answer"
    \[0.15 \times 200 = 30\]

!!! example "Problem 4"
    A 500 mL bag of D10W contains 10% dextrose. 
    How many grams of dextrose are in the bag?

??? success "Answer"
    10% means 10 g per 100 mL.
    \[\frac{10 \text{ g}}{100 \text{ mL}} \times 500 \text{ mL} = 50 \text{ g of dextrose}\]

!!! example "Problem 5"
    A patient scored 18 out of 20 on a pain assessment tool. 
    What is their score as a percentage?

??? success "Answer"
    \[\frac{18}{20} \times 100 = 90\%\]

!!! warning "Clinical Tip"
    When reading IV solution labels, pay close attention to the 
    percentage concentration. A 10% solution is 10 times more 
    concentrated than a 1% solution. Always verify the label 
    against the medication order before hanging a bag.
