# Decimals

## What Are Decimals?

Decimals are another way to express fractions using place value. 
The decimal point separates whole numbers on the left from 
fractional parts on the right.

| Place | Hundreds | Tens | Ones | . | Tenths | Hundredths | Thousandths |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Example | 0 | 0 | 3 | . | 4 | 5 | 6 |

In nursing, decimals are everywhere — medication doses, 
IV rates, lab values, and weight-based calculations.

## Patient Safety Rules

!!! danger "Leading Zero Rule"
    Always write a zero before a decimal point.
    Write **0.5 mg** — never **.5 mg**
    A missing leading zero can cause a 10x overdose.

!!! danger "Trailing Zero Rule"
    Never write a zero after a decimal point in medication doses.
    Write **5 mg** — never **5.0 mg**
    A trailing zero can be misread as 50 mg.

## Operations with Decimals

### Addition and Subtraction

Line up the decimal points and add or subtract normally.

\[3.75 + 1.50 = 5.25\]

### Multiplication

Multiply as whole numbers, then count total decimal places 
in both numbers and place the decimal point accordingly.

\[2.5 \times 1.4 = 3.50\]

### Division

Move the decimal point in the divisor to make it a whole number, 
then move the dividend's decimal point the same number of places.

\[3.6 \div 1.2 = 36 \div 12 = 3\]

## Comparing Decimals

Line up decimal points and compare digit by digit from left to right.

!!! example "Which is larger — 0.9 or 0.125?"
```
    0.900
    0.125
```
    Comparing tenths place: 9 > 1, therefore **0.9 is larger**

This matters clinically — misreading decimal size can lead to 
incorrect dose comparisons.

## Clinical Application

**Example:**
A patient needs 1.5 mg of a medication. The stock tablet contains 
0.5 mg per tablet. How many tablets are needed?

\[\frac{1.5 \text{ mg}}{0.5 \text{ mg}} = 3 \text{ tablets}\]

## Practice Problems

!!! example "Problem 1"
    Add: \(2.75 + 0.5\)

??? success "Answer"
    \[2.75 + 0.50 = 3.25\]

!!! example "Problem 2"
    Which is larger — 0.25 or 0.3?

??? success "Answer"
```
    0.30
    0.25
```
    **0.3 is larger.** In tenths place: 3 > 2.

!!! example "Problem 3"
    A patient requires 2.5 mg per dose, twice daily for 5 days.
    What is the total amount of medication needed?

??? success "Answer"
    \[2.5 \times 2 \times 5 = 25 \text{ mg total}\]

!!! example "Problem 4"
    Which notation is correct for a half milligram dose?

??? success "Answer"
    **0.5 mg** — always use a leading zero. Never write .5 mg.

!!! warning "Clinical Tip"
    When in doubt about a decimal dose, say it out loud. 
    "Point five" is easy to mishear as "five." Always confirm 
    unusual doses with a colleague before administering.
