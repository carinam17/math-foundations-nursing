# Rounding

## Why Rounding Matters in Nursing

Calculations rarely produce clean whole numbers. Knowing when 
and how to round correctly is essential for safe medication 
administration. Rounding incorrectly — even by a small amount — 
can lead to under or overdosing.

## The Basic Rounding Rule

Look at the digit immediately to the **right** of where you are rounding:

- If it is **5 or greater** — round **up**
- If it is **4 or less** — round **down** (keep the digit the same)

## Rounding to the Nearest Whole Number

Look at the tenths place (first digit after decimal):

\[3.7 \rightarrow 4\]
\[3.4 \rightarrow 3\]
\[12.5 \rightarrow 13\]

## Rounding to the Nearest Tenth

Look at the hundredths place (second digit after decimal):

\[3.45 \rightarrow 3.5\]
\[3.44 \rightarrow 3.4\]
\[0.678 \rightarrow 0.7\]

## Rounding to the Nearest Hundredth

Look at the thousandths place (third digit after decimal):

\[3.456 \rightarrow 3.46\]
\[3.454 \rightarrow 3.45\]
\[0.1255 \rightarrow 0.13\]

## Nursing Rounding Standards

!!! info "Standard Practice"
    In most clinical settings:

    - **Oral medications** — round to the nearest **tenth** (one decimal place)
    - **IV rates** — round to the nearest **whole number** (mL/hr)
    - **Weight-based doses** — round to the nearest **tenth**
    - **Pediatric doses** — follow facility policy, often nearest hundredth

!!! warning "Always Check Facility Policy"
    Rounding rules can vary by institution and medication type. 
    Always follow your facility's specific guidelines and double 
    check high-alert medications with a second nurse.

## Clinical Application

**Example:**
A calculated dose is 3.678 mg. Following oral medication 
rounding standards, what do you administer?

\[3.678 \rightarrow 3.7 \text{ mg}\]

**Example:**
An IV pump requires a whole number rate. Your calculation 
yields 42.6 mL/hr. What do you set the pump to?

\[42.6 \rightarrow 43 \text{ mL/hr}\]

## Practice Problems

!!! example "Problem 1"
    Round 4.678 to the nearest tenth.

??? success "Answer"
    Look at hundredths place: 7 ≥ 5, round up.
    \[4.678 \rightarrow 4.7\]

!!! example "Problem 2"
    Round 12.344 to the nearest hundredth.

??? success "Answer"
    Look at thousandths place: 4 < 5, round down.
    \[12.344 \rightarrow 12.34\]

!!! example "Problem 3"
    A calculated oral dose is 5.549 mg. What do you administer?

??? success "Answer"
    Round to nearest tenth. Look at hundredths place: 4 < 5, round down.
    \[5.549 \rightarrow 5.5 \text{ mg}\]

!!! example "Problem 4"
    An IV rate calculates to 87.5 mL/hr. What do you set the pump to?

??? success "Answer"
    Round to nearest whole number. Look at tenths place: 5 ≥ 5, round up.
    \[87.5 \rightarrow 88 \text{ mL/hr}\]

!!! example "Problem 5"
    Round 0.0449 to the nearest hundredth.

??? success "Answer"
    Look at thousandths place: 4 < 5, round down.
    \[0.0449 \rightarrow 0.04\]

!!! danger "Common Mistake"
    Do not round multiple times in one calculation. For example, 
    do not round an intermediate step and then round again at the end. 
    Always carry full precision through the calculation and 
    round only the **final answer**.
