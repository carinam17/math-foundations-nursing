## Operations Review


### Addition and Subtraction

1. Line up numbers by place value and work right to left.



**Clinical example:**
A patient receives 2 tablets in the morning, 1 at noon, and 2 at night.
How many tablets per day?

\[2 + 1 + 2 = 5 \text{ tablets per day}\]

### Multiplication

**Clinical example:**
A patient takes 3 tablets per dose, 4 times daily, for 7 days.
How many tablets are needed total?

\[3 \times 4 \times 7 = 84 \text{ tablets}\]

### Division

**Clinical example:**
A bottle contains 100 tablets. A patient takes 4 per day.
How many days will the bottle last?

\[100 \div 4 = 25 \text{ days}\]
