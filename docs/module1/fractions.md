## What Are Fractions?

A fraction represents a part of a whole. It has two parts:

- **Numerator** — the top number (how many parts you have)
- **Denominator** — the bottom number (how many parts make a whole)

\[\frac{\text{numerator}}{\text{denominator}}\]

In nursing, fractions appear in medication labels, dosage calculations, 
and unit conversions.

## Simplifying Fractions

Divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor.

\[\frac{6}{8} = \frac{6 \div 2}{8 \div 2} = \frac{3}{4}\]

## Multiplying Fractions

Multiply numerators together and denominators together.

\[\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1 \times 3}{2 \times 4} = \frac{3}{8}\]

## Dividing Fractions

Flip the second fraction and multiply.

\[\frac{1}{2} \div \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{1} = \frac{4}{2} = 2\]

## Adding and Subtracting Fractions

Fractions must have a common denominator first.

\[\frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4}\]

If denominators differ, find the least common denominator:

\[\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4}\]

## Clinical Application
