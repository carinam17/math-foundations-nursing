# Module 2 – Units of Measurement & Conversions

## Overview

Accurate unit conversion is one of the most critical skills in nursing 
practice. Medication orders, lab values, and IV solutions all use 
specific units of measurement. A conversion error can result in a 
serious medication error.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module you should be able to:

- Identify and use units of the metric system
- Identify common household measurements
- Convert between units within the metric system
- Convert between metric and household measurements
- Apply dimensional analysis to solve conversion problems

## Topics

- [The Metric System](metric-system.md)
- [Household Measurements](household-measurements.md)
- [Converting Between Units](conversions.md)
- [Dimensional Analysis](dimensional-analysis.md)

## Estimated Time

Approximately 1.5–2 hours including practice problems.

!!! tip "Before You Begin"
    Memorizing a few key conversions will make the rest of this 
    module much easier. The most important ones in nursing are:

    - 1 kg = 2.2 lb
    - 1 g = 1000 mg
    - 1 mg = 1000 mcg
    - 1 L = 1000 mL
    - 1 tsp = 5 mL
    - 1 tbsp = 15 mL

!!! info "Why This Matters"
    Medication orders may be written in one unit while stock is 
    labeled in another. For example, an order for 0.5 g when 
    tablets are labeled in mg. You must convert confidently 
    before calculating any dose.
