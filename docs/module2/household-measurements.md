# Household Measurements

## Overview

While the metric system is standard in clinical settings, nurses 
frequently encounter household measurements when:

- Taking medication histories from patients
- Instructing patients on home medication administration
- Working with liquid medications measured by spoon or cup

Understanding how household units relate to metric units is 
essential for patient education and safe home care instructions.

## Common Household Units

### Volume

| Household Unit | Abbreviation | Metric Equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| teaspoon | tsp | 5 mL |
| tablespoon | tbsp | 15 mL |
| fluid ounce | fl oz | 30 mL |
| cup | c | 240 mL |
| pint | pt | 480 mL |
| quart | qt | 960 mL |

### Weight

| Household Unit | Abbreviation | Metric Equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| ounce | oz | 30 g |
| pound | lb | 453.6 g |
| pound | lb | 0.454 kg |

### Key Weight Conversion

\[1 \text{ kg} = 2.2 \text{ lb}\]

This is the most important household-to-metric weight conversion 
in nursing — used constantly for weight-based dosing.

## Memorization Tips

!!! tip "Volume Relationships"
    Build up from the teaspoon:

    \[1 \text{ tbsp} = 3 \text{ tsp} = 15 \text{ mL}\]
    \[1 \text{ fl oz} = 2 \text{ tbsp} = 30 \text{ mL}\]
    \[1 \text{ cup} = 8 \text{ fl oz} = 240 \mL}\]

!!! tip "Weight Shortcut"
    To convert **lb to kg** — divide by 2.2
    
    To convert **kg to lb** — multiply by 2.2

## Clinical Application

**Example 1:**
A patient reports taking 2 teaspoons of liquid medication at home.
Convert to mL for the medication record:

\[2 \text{ tsp} \times 5 \text{ mL/tsp} = 10 \text{ mL}\]

**Example 2:**
A patient weighs 154 lb. A weight-based medication requires 
the weight in kg. Convert:

\[154 \text{ lb} \div 2.2 = 70 \text{ kg}\]

**Example 3:**
A discharge instruction says to take 1 tablespoon of medication 
twice daily. How many mL per day?

\[1 \text{ tbsp} = 15 \text{ mL} \times 2 = 30 \text{ mL/day}\]

**Example 4:**
A patient is prescribed 30 mL of an oral solution. 
How many tablespoons should you instruct them to take at home?

\[30 \text{ mL} \div 15 \text{ mL/tbsp} = 2 \text{ tbsp}\]

## Patient Education

!!! warning "Spoon Sizes Vary"
    Household spoons are not standardized. A kitchen teaspoon 
    may hold anywhere from 3 to 7 mL. Always instruct patients 
    to use a **calibrated measuring device** — oral syringe, 
    medicine cup, or dosing spoon — rather than a kitchen spoon.

!!! info "Documenting Intake"
    In clinical settings, fluid intake is always documented 
    in **mL**, never in household units. Convert any household 
    measurements before recording.

## Practice Problems

!!! example "Problem 1"
    A patient takes 3 teaspoons of cough syrup. Convert to mL.

??? success "Answer"
    \[3 \text{ tsp} \times 5 \text{ mL/tsp} = 15 \text{ mL}\]

!!! example "Problem 2"
    Convert 88 lb to kg.

??? success "Answer"
    \[88 \text{ lb} \div 2.2 = 40 \text{ kg}\]

!!! example "Problem 3"
    A patient needs to take 45 mL of an oral solution at home. 
    How many tablespoons is that?

??? success "Answer"
    \[45 \text{ mL} \div 15 \text{ mL/tbsp} = 3 \text{ tbsp}\]

!!! example "Problem 4"
    Convert 60 kg to lb.

??? success "Answer"
    \[60 \text{ kg} \times 2.2 = 132 \text{ lb}\]

!!! example "Problem 5"
    A child weighs 44 lb. A weight-based antibiotic is ordered 
    at 10 mg/kg. What is the child's weight in kg and 
    what is the dose?

??? success "Answer"
    Step 1 — Convert weight:
    \[44 \text{ lb} \div 2.2 = 20 \text{ kg}\]
    
    Step 2 — Calculate dose:
    \[10 \text{ mg/kg} \times 20 \text{ kg} = 200 \text{ mg}\]

!!! warning "Clinical Tip"
    Always obtain and document patient weight in **kg** in clinical 
    settings. If a patient only knows their weight in pounds, 
    convert immediately and record in kg to avoid confusion 
    during weight-based dosing calculations.
