# The Metric System

## Why Metric?

The metric system is the international standard for medication 
dosing and clinical measurement. Unlike household measurements, 
the metric system is decimal-based — everything scales by 
powers of 10, making conversions straightforward.

## Base Units in Nursing

| Measurement | Base Unit | Abbreviation |
|---|---|---|
| Weight | gram | g |
| Volume | liter | L |
| Length | meter | m |

## Prefixes

Prefixes modify the base unit by a power of 10:

| Prefix | Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| kilo | k | × 1000 | 1 kg = 1000 g |
| (base) | — | × 1 | 1 g |
| milli | m | × 0.001 | 1 mg = 0.001 g |
| micro | mc or µ | × 0.000001 | 1 mcg = 0.001 mg |

!!! info "Memory Tip"
    Think of it as a staircase — each step down multiplies by 1000:
    
    \[\text{kg} \rightarrow \text{g} \rightarrow \text{mg} \rightarrow \text{mcg}\]
    
    Moving **down** the staircase (larger to smaller unit) — multiply by 1000
    
    Moving **up** the staircase (smaller to larger unit) — divide by 1000

## Key Weight Conversions

\[1 \text{ kg} = 1000 \text{ g}\]
\[1 \text{ g} = 1000 \text{ mg}\]
\[1 \text{ mg} = 1000 \text{ mcg}\]

## Key Volume Conversions

\[1 \text{ L} = 1000 \text{ mL}\]
\[1 \text{ dL} = 100 \text{ mL}\]

## Abbreviation Safety

!!! danger "mcg vs mg"
    Never abbreviate microgram as **µg** in handwritten orders — 
    it can be misread as **mg**, resulting in a 1000x overdose.
    Always write **mcg** in full.

!!! danger "Units of Insulin"
    Never abbreviate **units** as **U** for insulin orders. 
    **U** can be misread as a zero, turning 4U into 40 units. 
    Always write **units** in full.

## Clinical Application

**Example 1:**
A medication order reads 0.5 g. Stock is labeled in mg. 
What is the equivalent dose in mg?

\[0.5 \text{ g} \times \frac{1000 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ g}} = 500 \text{ mg}\]

**Example 2:**
A patient weighs 75 kg. A weight-based dose requires the 
weight in grams. Convert:

\[75 \text{ kg} \times \frac{1000 \text{ g}}{1 \text{ kg}} = 75{,}000 \text{ g}\]

**Example 3:**
A lab value is reported as 1500 mcg. Convert to mg:

\[1500 \text{ mcg} \times \frac{1 \text{ mg}}{1000 \text{ mcg}} = 1.5 \text{ mg}\]

## Practice Problems

!!! example "Problem 1"
    Convert 2.5 g to mg.

??? success "Answer"
    \[2.5 \text{ g} \times 1000 = 2500 \text{ mg}\]

!!! example "Problem 2"
    Convert 750 mg to g.

??? success "Answer"
    \[750 \text{ mg} \div 1000 = 0.75 \text{ g}\]

!!! example "Problem 3"
    Convert 0.25 mg to mcg.

??? success "Answer"
    \[0.25 \text{ mg} \times 1000 = 250 \text{ mcg}\]

!!! example "Problem 4"
    Convert 2500 mL to L.

??? success "Answer"
    \[2500 \text{ mL} \div 1000 = 2.5 \text{ L}\]

!!! example "Problem 5"
    An order reads 0.125 mg. Stock is labeled in mcg. 
    What is the equivalent dose?

??? success "Answer"
    \[0.125 \text{ mg} \times 1000 = 125 \text{ mcg}\]

!!! warning "Clinical Tip"
    When converting between metric units always ask yourself — 
    am I going to a smaller or larger unit? 
    Smaller unit = larger number. Larger unit = smaller number. 
    If your answer goes the wrong direction, recheck your work.
