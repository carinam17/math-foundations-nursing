# Converting Between Units

## Overview

Unit conversion is the process of expressing a measurement in 
a different unit while keeping the same value. In nursing, you 
will constantly convert between units — metric to metric, 
household to metric, and back again.

## The Conversion Factor Method

A conversion factor is a fraction that equals 1, where the 
numerator and denominator represent the same quantity in 
different units.

\[\frac{1000 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ g}} = 1\]

Because it equals 1, multiplying by it changes the unit 
without changing the value.

## Step-by-Step Method

1. Write down what you **have**
2. Write down what you **want**
3. Choose a conversion factor that cancels the unwanted unit
4. Multiply and simplify
5. Check that your answer makes sense

**Example:**
Convert 2.5 g to mg.

| Step | Work |
|---|---|
| Have | 2.5 g |
| Want | mg |
| Conversion factor | \(\frac{1000 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ g}}\) |
| Calculate | \(2.5 \text{ g} \times \frac{1000 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ g}} = 2500 \text{ mg}\) |
| Check | mg is smaller than g, so number should be larger ✅ |

## Common Conversions Reference

### Weight
\[1 \text{ kg} = 2.2 \text{ lb}\]
\[1 \text{ kg} = 1000 \text{ g}\]
\[1 \text{ g} = 1000 \text{ mg}\]
\[1 \text{ mg} = 1000 \text{ mcg}\]

### Volume
\[1 \text{ L} = 1000 \text{ mL}\]
\[1 \text{ tbsp} = 15 \text{ mL}\]
\[1 \text{ tsp} = 5 \text{ mL}\]
\[1 \text{ fl oz} = 30 \text{ mL}\]

## Multi-Step Conversions

Sometimes you need more than one conversion factor.

**Example:**
Convert 3 tbsp to mL, then to L.

Step 1 — tbsp to mL:
\[3 \text{ tbsp} \times \frac{15 \text{ mL}}{1 \text{ tbsp}} = 45 \text{ mL}\]

Step 2 — mL to L:
\[45 \text{ mL} \times \frac{1 \text{ L}}{1000 \text{ mL}} = 0.045 \text{ L}\]

Or in one step:
\[3 \text{ tbsp} \times \frac{15 \text{ mL}}{1 \text{ tbsp}} \times \frac{1 \text{ L}}{1000 \text{ mL}} = 0.045 \text{ L}\]

## Sanity Checks

!!! tip "Always Ask Yourself"
    - Am I converting to a **smaller** unit? → answer should be a **larger** number
    - Am I converting to a **larger** unit? → answer should be a **smaller** number
    
    If your answer goes the wrong direction, flip your conversion factor.

## Clinical Application

**Example 1:**
An order reads 0.25 g of amoxicillin. Stock is labeled 250 mg 
per tablet. Are these the same dose?

\[0.25 \text{ g} \times \frac{1000 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ g}} = 250 \text{ mg} ✅\]

Yes — give 1 tablet.

**Example 2:**
A patient weighs 176 lb. A drug is dosed at 5 mg/kg. 
What is the patient's weight in kg?

\[176 \text{ lb} \div 2.2 = 80 \text{ kg}\]

**Example 3:**
An IV bag contains 1.5 L. How many mL is that?

\[1.5 \text{ L} \times \frac{1000 \text{ mL}}{1 \text{ L}} = 1500 \text{ mL}\]

## Practice Problems

!!! example "Problem 1"
    Convert 0.75 g to mg.

??? success "Answer"
    \[0.75 \text{ g} \times 1000 = 750 \text{ mg}\]

!!! example "Problem 2"
    Convert 1500 mcg to mg.

??? success "Answer"
    \[1500 \text{ mcg} \div 1000 = 1.5 \text{ mg}\]

!!! example "Problem 3"
    A patient weighs 132 lb. Convert to kg.

??? success "Answer"
    \[132 \text{ lb} \div 2.2 = 60 \text{ kg}\]

!!! example "Problem 4"
    An order is for 500 mcg. Stock is labeled 0.25 mg per tablet. 
    Are these equivalent?

??? success "Answer"
    Convert order to mg:
    \[500 \text{ mcg} \div 1000 = 0.5 \text{ mg}\]
    
    0.5 mg ≠ 0.25 mg — **not equivalent.** You would need 2 tablets.

!!! example "Problem 5"
    Convert 2.5 L to mL.

??? success "Answer"
    \[2.5 \text{ L} \times 1000 = 2500 \text{ mL}\]

!!! example "Problem 6"
    A patient takes 4 tsp of liquid medication at home. 
    Convert to mL and then to tablespoons for documentation.

??? success "Answer"
    Step 1 — tsp to mL:
    \[4 \text{ tsp} \times 5 \text{ mL/tsp} = 20 \text{ mL}\]
    
    Step 2 — mL to tbsp:
    \[20 \text{ mL} \div 15 \text{ mL/tbsp} = 1.33 \text{ tbsp}\]

!!! warning "Clinical Tip"
    When in doubt, convert everything to the same unit before 
    comparing or calculating. Never try to mentally jump between 
    units mid-calculation — write every step out until 
    conversions become second nature.
