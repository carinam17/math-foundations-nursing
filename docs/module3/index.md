# Module 3 - Ratio and Proportion

## Overview

Ratio and proportion form the mathematical backbone of nearly 
every dosage calculation in nursing. Once you can confidently 
set up and solve a proportion, most medication calculations 
become straightforward.

This module builds directly on the conversion and dimensional 
analysis skills from Module 2.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module you should be able to:

- Define and write ratios in multiple formats
- Set up and solve proportions
- Use cross-multiplication to find unknown values
- Apply ratio and proportion to clinical dosage problems
- Recognize when an answer is unreasonable

## Topics

- [Ratios](ratios.md)
- [Proportions](proportions.md)
- [Cross Multiplication](cross-multiplication.md)
- [Clinical Applications](clinical-applications.md)

## Estimated Time

Approximately 1.5-2 hours including practice problems.

!!! tip "Before You Begin"
    Make sure you are comfortable with fractions and unit 
    conversions from Modules 1 and 2. Every proportion in 
    this module involves fractions — if they feel shaky, 
    do a quick review before continuing.

!!! info "Connection to Dimensional Analysis"
    Ratio and proportion and dimensional analysis are two 
    different approaches to the same problems. Some nurses 
    prefer one method, some prefer the other. Learning both 
    gives you flexibility and a way to double-check your work.
