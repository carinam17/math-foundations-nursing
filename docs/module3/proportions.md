# Proportions

## What Is a Proportion?

A proportion is a statement that two ratios are equal:

\[\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}\]

In nursing, proportions let us solve for an unknown quantity 
when we know three of the four values. This is the core 
of most dosage calculations.

## Setting Up a Proportion

The key is keeping units consistent — the same unit must 
appear in the same position on both sides.

\[\frac{\text{dose on hand}}{\text{quantity on hand}} = \frac{\text{desired dose}}{\text{desired quantity}}\]

**Example:**
Stock: 250 mg per tablet
Order: 500 mg
How many tablets?

\[\frac{250 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ tablet}} = \frac{500 \text{ mg}}{x \text{ tablets}}\]

## Solving for the Unknown

Once the proportion is set up, solve using cross-multiplication 
(covered in detail in the next section):

\[250x = 500 \times 1\]
\[x = \frac{500}{250} = 2 \text{ tablets}\]

## The Means and Extremes

In a proportion written in colon format:

\[a : b = c : d\]

- **Extremes** are the outer values: a and d
- **Means** are the inner values: b and c
- The product of the means always equals the product of the extremes

\[a \times d = b \times c\]

This is the mathematical basis for cross-multiplication.

## Checking Your Answer

Always verify by substituting your answer back into 
the original proportion:

\[\frac{250 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ tablet}} = \frac{500 \text{ mg}}{2 \text{ tablets}}\]

Simplify the right side:
\[\frac{500}{2} = 250 ✅\]

Both sides are equal — the answer is correct.

## Recognizing Unreasonable Answers

!!! warning "Reasonableness Check"
    Before accepting any answer ask yourself:

    - Would a nurse realistically give this many tablets?
    - Is this volume reasonable to administer?
    - Does the answer make sense given the order and stock?

    General guidelines:
    - Oral tablets: rarely more than **3 tablets** per dose
    - Oral liquid: typically between **5 mL and 30 mL** per dose
    - If your answer falls outside these ranges, recheck your work

## Clinical Application

**Example 1:**
Stock: 125 mg/5 mL oral suspension
Order: 250 mg
How many mL?

\[\frac{125 \text{ mg}}{5 \text{ mL}} = \frac{250 \text{ mg}}{x \text{ mL}}\]

\[125x = 250 \times 5\]
\[125x = 1250\]
\[x = \frac{1250}{125} = 10 \text{ mL}\]

**Example 2:**
Stock: 40 mg/mL injectable solution
Order: 100 mg
How many mL?

\[\frac{40 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ mL}} = \frac{100 \text{ mg}}{x \text{ mL}}\]

\[40x = 100\]
\[x = \frac{100}{40} = 2.5 \text{ mL}\]

## Practice Problems

!!! example "Problem 1"
    Stock: 500 mg per tablet
    Order: 1000 mg
    How many tablets?

??? success "Answer"
    \[\frac{500 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ tablet}} = \frac{1000 \text{ mg}}{x \text{ tablets}}\]
    \[500x = 1000\]
    \[x = 2 \text{ tablets}\]

!!! example "Problem 2"
    Stock: 250 mg/5 mL
    Order: 375 mg
    How many mL?

??? success "Answer"
    \[\frac{250 \text{ mg}}{5 \text{ mL}} = \frac{375 \text{ mg}}{x \text{ mL}}\]
    \[250x = 375 \times 5\]
    \[250x = 1875\]
    \[x = \frac{1875}{250} = 7.5 \text{ mL}\]

!!! example "Problem 3"
    Stock: 0.25 mg per tablet
    Order: 0.5 mg
    How many tablets?

??? success "Answer"
    \[\frac{0.25 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ tablet}} = \frac{0.5 \text{ mg}}{x \text{ tablets}}\]
    \[0.25x = 0.5\]
    \[x = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \text{ tablets}\]

!!! example "Problem 4"
    Stock: 10 mg/mL
    Order: 25 mg
    How many mL?

??? success "Answer"
    \[\frac{10 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ mL}} = \frac{25 \text{ mg}}{x \text{ mL}}\]
    \[10x = 25\]
    \[x = 2.5 \text{ mL}\]

!!! example "Problem 5"
    Stock: 80 mg/2 mL
    Order: 60 mg
    How many mL?

??? success "Answer"
    \[\frac{80 \text{ mg}}{2 \text{ mL}} = \frac{60 \text{ mg}}{x \text{ mL}}\]
    \[80x = 60 \times 2\]
    \[80x = 120\]
    \[x = \frac{120}{80} = 1.5 \text{ mL}\]

!!! tip "Double Check Method"
    After solving, always verify:
    \[\frac{80 \text{ mg}}{2 \text{ mL}} = \frac{60 \text{ mg}}{1.5 \text{ mL}}\]
    \[80 \times 1.5 = 120 = 60 \times 2 ✅\]
