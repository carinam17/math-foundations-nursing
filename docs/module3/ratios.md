# Ratios

## What Is a Ratio?

A ratio expresses a relationship between two quantities. 
In nursing, ratios describe concentrations, doses, and rates — 
how much of something exists relative to something else.

## Writing Ratios

A ratio can be written three ways — all equivalent:

| Format | Example |
|---|---|
| Fraction | \(\frac{250 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ tablet}}\) |
| Colon notation | 250 mg : 1 tablet |
| Word form | 250 mg per tablet |

In calculations, the **fraction format** is preferred because 
it integrates cleanly with dimensional analysis.

## Ratios in Medication Labels

Every medication label expresses a ratio:

| Label | Ratio Meaning |
|---|---|
| 500 mg per tablet | 500 mg : 1 tablet |
| 250 mg/5 mL | 250 mg : 5 mL |
| 10 units/mL | 10 units : 1 mL |
| 0.9% NaCl | 0.9 g : 100 mL |

!!! info "Reading Concentration Ratios"
    A concentration like **250 mg/5 mL** tells you exactly 
    how much drug is in how much liquid. This is your 
    **stock ratio** — the foundation of every liquid 
    medication calculation.

## Unit Rates

A unit rate simplifies a ratio so the denominator equals 1.
This makes comparisons and calculations easier.

**Example:**
Stock is 250 mg/5 mL. What is the unit rate (mg per mL)?

\[\frac{250 \text{ mg}}{5 \text{ mL}} = \frac{50 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ mL}}\]

There are 50 mg in every 1 mL of this solution.

## Equivalent Ratios

Two ratios are equivalent if they simplify to the same value.
This is the foundation of proportion — covered in the next section.

\[\frac{250 \text{ mg}}{5 \text{ mL}} = \frac{500 \text{ mg}}{10 \text{ mL}} = \frac{50 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ mL}}\]

All three express the same concentration.

## Clinical Application

**Example 1:**
A stock solution is labeled 1000 mg/250 mL. 
Express as a unit rate.

\[\frac{1000 \text{ mg}}{250 \text{ mL}} = \frac{4 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ mL}}\]

There are 4 mg of drug in every 1 mL.

**Example 2:**
Two solutions are available:
- Solution A: 500 mg/10 mL
- Solution B: 250 mg/4 mL

Which is more concentrated?

Solution A unit rate:
\[\frac{500 \text{ mg}}{10 \text{ mL}} = \frac{50 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ mL}}\]

Solution B unit rate:
\[\frac{250 \text{ mg}}{4 \text{ mL}} = \frac{62.5 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ mL}}\]

**Solution B is more concentrated.**

## Practice Problems

!!! example "Problem 1"
    Write the ratio 5 mg per 2 mL in fraction format.

??? success "Answer"
    \[\frac{5 \text{ mg}}{2 \text{ mL}}\]

!!! example "Problem 2"
    A stock solution contains 125 mg/5 mL. 
    What is the unit rate in mg/mL?

??? success "Answer"
    \[\frac{125 \text{ mg}}{5 \text{ mL}} = \frac{25 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ mL}}\]

!!! example "Problem 3"
    Are these ratios equivalent?
    \(\frac{250 \text{ mg}}{5 \text{ mL}}\) and \(\frac{500 \text{ mg}}{10 \text{ mL}}\)

??? success "Answer"
    Simplify both to unit rates:
    \[\frac{250}{5} = 50 \text{ mg/mL}\]
    \[\frac{500}{10} = 50 \text{ mg/mL}\]
    
    **Yes — they are equivalent.**

!!! example "Problem 4"
    A medication label reads 0.5 mg/2 mL. 
    Express as a unit rate.

??? success "Answer"
    \[\frac{0.5 \text{ mg}}{2 \text{ mL}} = \frac{0.25 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ mL}}\]

!!! example "Problem 5"
    Which solution is more concentrated?
    - Solution A: 200 mg/4 mL
    - Solution B: 150 mg/2 mL

??? success "Answer"
    Solution A:
    \[\frac{200 \text{ mg}}{4 \text{ mL}} = 50 \text{ mg/mL}\]
    
    Solution B:
    \[\frac{150 \text{ mg}}{2 \text{ mL}} = 75 \text{ mg/mL}\]
    
    **Solution B is more concentrated.**

!!! warning "Clinical Tip"
    Always identify the stock ratio from the medication label 
    before starting any calculation. Writing it down explicitly 
    as a fraction prevents confusion and sets up your 
    dimensional analysis chain correctly.
