# IV Flow Rates

## Overview

An IV flow rate tells you how many milliliters of fluid 
to deliver per hour (mL/hr). This is the standard unit 
for programming electronic infusion pumps in clinical 
practice.

## The Basic Formula

\[\text{Flow Rate (mL/hr)} = \frac{\text{Volume (mL)}}{\text{Time (hr)}}\]

This is the foundation of all IV flow rate calculations.

## Simple Flow Rate Calculations

**Example 1:**
Order: 1000 mL 0.9% NaCl over 8 hours
What is the flow rate in mL/hr?

\[\frac{1000 \text{ mL}}{8 \text{ hr}} = 125 \text{ mL/hr}\]

**Example 2:**
Order: 500 mL D5W over 4 hours
What is the flow rate in mL/hr?

\[\frac{500 \text{ mL}}{4 \text{ hr}} = 125 \text{ mL/hr}\]

**Example 3:**
Order: 250 mL 0.45% NaCl over 3 hours
What is the flow rate in mL/hr?

\[\frac{250 \text{ mL}}{3 \text{ hr}} = 83.3 \text{ mL/hr}\]

Round to nearest whole number: **83 mL/hr**

!!! info "Rounding IV Rates"
    IV pump rates are set in **whole numbers** (mL/hr).
    Always round flow rates to the nearest whole number 
    unless your facility pump supports decimal rates.

## Time Conversion

Orders are sometimes written in minutes rather than hours.

**Example 4:**
Order: 100 mL 0.9% NaCl over 30 minutes
What is the flow rate in mL/hr?

Convert 30 minutes to hours first:
\[30 \text{ min} \times \frac{1 \text{ hr}}{60 \text{ min}} = 0.5 \text{ hr}\]

Then calculate rate:
\[\frac{100 \text{ mL}}{0.5 \text{ hr}} = 200 \text{ mL/hr}\]

**Example 5:**
Order: 250 mL over 90 minutes
What is the flow rate in mL/hr?

\[90 \text{ min} \times \frac{1 \text{ hr}}{60 \text{ min}} = 1.5 \text{ hr}\]

\[\frac{250 \text{ mL}}{1.5 \text{ hr}} = 166.7 \text{ mL/hr}\]

Round to nearest whole number: **167 mL/hr**

## Calculating Volume from Rate and Time

Sometimes you need to find the total volume infused 
given a rate and a time period.

\[\text{Volume (mL)} = \text{Rate (mL/hr)} \times \text{Time (hr)}\]

**Example 6:**
An IV is running at 125 mL/hr. How much fluid will 
the patient receive in 6 hours?

\[125 \text{ mL/hr} \times 6 \text{ hr} = 750 \text{ mL}\]

**Example 7:**
An IV is running at 75 mL/hr. How much fluid will 
the patient receive in 8 hours?

\[75 \text{ mL/hr} \times 8 \text{ hr} = 600 \text{ mL}\]

## Remaining Volume and Time

**Example 8:**
An IV of 1000 mL is running at 125 mL/hr. 
After 3 hours, how much fluid remains?

Step 1 — volume infused:
\[125 \text{ mL/hr} \times 3 \text{ hr} = 375 \text{ mL}\]

Step 2 — volume remaining:
\[1000 \text{ mL} - 375 \text{ mL} = 625 \text{ mL}\]

Step 3 — time remaining:
\[\frac{625 \text{ mL}}{125 \text{ mL/hr}} = 5 \text{ hr}\]

## Pump Programming

!!! warning "Verify Pump Settings"
    When programming an IV pump always verify:
    
    1. **Rate** — mL/hr matches your calculation
    2. **Volume to be infused (VTBI)** — total volume of the bag
    3. **Drug library** — if pump has one, select correct drug
    4. **Soft and hard limits** — ensure alerts are active
    5. **Second nurse check** — for high alert medications

## Practice Problems

??? success "Answer"
    \[\frac{500 \text{ mL}}{6 \text{ hr}} = 83.3 \text{ mL/hr}\]

    Calculate rate:
    \[\frac{150 \text{ mL}}{0.75 \text{ hr}} = 200 \text{ mL/hr}\]

!!! example "Problem 4"

    How much fluid does the patient receive in 12 hours?

??? success "Answer"
    \[100 \text{ mL/hr} \times 12 \text{ hr} = 1200 \text{ mL}\]

!!! example "Problem 5"
    A 1000 mL bag is running at 150 mL/hr.
    After 4 hours how much fluid remains 
    and how much longer will it run?

??? success "Answer"
    Volume infused:
    \[150 \text{ mL/hr} \times 4 \text{ hr} = 600 \text{ mL}\]
    
    Volume remaining:
    \[1000 - 600 = 400 \text{ mL}\]
    
    Time remaining:
    \[\frac{400 \text{ mL}}{150 \text{ mL/hr}} = 2.67 \text{ hr}\]
    
    Approximately **2 hours and 40 minutes** remaining.

!!! example "Problem 6"
    Order: 250 mL over 20 minutes
    What is the flow rate in mL/hr?

??? success "Answer"
    Convert time:
    \[20 \text{ min} \times \frac{1 \text{ hr}}{60 \text{ min}} = 0.33 \text{ hr}\]
    
    Calculate rate:
    \[\frac{250 \text{ mL}}{0.33 \text{ hr}} = 757.6 \text{ mL/hr}\]
    
    Round to: **758 mL/hr**
    
    !!! warning "Verify This Rate"
        Rates above 500 mL/hr are unusual for most 
        clinical situations. Verify the order and 
        confirm with the prescriber before programming 
        the pump.

!!! warning "Clinical Tip"
    After programming an IV pump always trace the 
    tubing from the bag to the patient before starting 
    the infusion. This confirms the correct fluid is 
    connected to the correct line and prevents 
    wrong-route errors.
