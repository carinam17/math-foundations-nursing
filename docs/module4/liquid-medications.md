# Liquid Medications

## Overview

Liquid medications are used when patients cannot swallow 
tablets or capsules, for pediatric patients, and for 
medications that are only available in liquid form. 
The calculation method is identical to tablets — unit 
cancellation — but the answer is a volume (mL) rather 
than a count.

## Reading Liquid Medication Labels

Liquid medications are labeled as a concentration:

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 250 mg/5 mL | 250 mg of drug in every 5 mL of liquid |
| 125 mg/5 mL | 125 mg of drug in every 5 mL of liquid |
| 10 mg/mL | 10 mg of drug in every 1 mL of liquid |
| 1 mg/mL | 1 mg of drug in every 1 mL of liquid |

!!! info "The Stock Ratio"
    The label concentration is your stock ratio. Always 
    write it as a fraction before setting up your calculation:
    
    250 mg/5 mL becomes \(\frac{5 \text{ mL}}{250 \text{ mg}}\)
    
    Note the mL goes in the numerator because mL is 
    what you want in your answer.

## Basic Liquid Calculation

**Example 1:**
Order: amoxicillin 250 mg orally
Stock: 125 mg/5 mL

\[\frac{250 \cancel{\text{ mg}}}{1} \times \frac{5 \text{ mL}}{125 \cancel{\text{ mg}}} = 10 \text{ mL}\]

**Example 2:**
Order: ibuprofen 400 mg orally
Stock: 200 mg/5 mL

\[\frac{400 \cancel{\text{ mg}}}{1} \times \frac{5 \text{ mL}}{200 \cancel{\text{ mg}}} = 10 \text{ mL}\]

**Example 3:**
Order: morphine 15 mg orally
Stock: 10 mg/mL oral solution

\[\frac{15 \cancel{\text{ mg}}}{1} \times \frac{1 \text{ mL}}{10 \cancel{\text{ mg}}} = 1.5 \text{ mL}\]

## Unit Conversion Required

**Example 4:**
Order: amoxicillin 0.5 g orally
Stock: 250 mg/5 mL

\[\frac{0.5 \cancel{\text{ g}}}{1} \times \frac{1000 \cancel{\text{ mg}}}{1 \cancel{\text{ g}}} \times \frac{5 \text{ mL}}{250 \cancel{\text{ mg}}} = 10 \text{ mL}\]

**Example 5:**
Order: clarithromycin 0.375 g orally
Stock: 125 mg/5 mL

\[\frac{0.375 \cancel{\text{ g}}}{1} \times \frac{1000 \cancel{\text{ mg}}}{1 \cancel{\text{ g}}} \times \frac{5 \text{ mL}}{125 \cancel{\text{ mg}}} = 15 \text{ mL}\]

## Measuring Liquid Medications

!!! warning "Always Use a Calibrated Device"
    Never use a kitchen spoon to measure liquid medications. 
    Always use one of the following:

    - **Oral syringe** — most accurate, especially for 
      small volumes under 5 mL
    - **Medicine cup** — suitable for volumes 5 mL and above
    - **Dosing spoon** — calibrated, acceptable for home use
    
    Read the measurement at **eye level** at the bottom 
    of the meniscus (the curved surface of the liquid).

## Reconstitution

Some liquid medications come as a powder that must be 
mixed with water before use.

!!! info "Reconstitution"
    When reconstituting a powder:
    
    1. Read the label for the exact amount of water to add
    2. Add the specified volume of water — not more, not less
    3. Shake or mix as directed
    4. Check the resulting concentration on the label
    5. Note the expiry date after reconstitution
    6. Label with date and time of reconstitution
    
    The concentration printed on the label only applies 
    **after** reconstitution with the specified volume.

## Reasonableness Check

!!! warning "Liquid Dose Safety Guidelines"
    - Oral liquid doses are typically between **5 mL and 30 mL**
    - Doses under 1 mL orally are unusual — recheck
    - Doses over 30 mL orally are unusual — recheck
    - Injectable liquid doses are typically **0.5 mL to 3 mL**

## Practice Problems

!!! example "Problem 1"

    How many mL?

??? success "Answer"
    \[\frac{10 \cancel{\text{ mg}}}{1} \times \frac{5 \text{ mL}}{5 \cancel{\text{ mg}}} = 10 \text{ mL}\]

    Stock: 250 mg/5 mL suspension
    How many mL?

??? success "Answer"
    \[\frac{500 \cancel{\text{ mg}}}{1} \times \frac{5 \text{ mL}}{250 \cancel{\text{ mg}}} = 10 \text{ mL}\]

??? success "Answer"
    \[\frac{7.5 \cancel{\text{ mg}}}{1} \times \frac{5 \text{ mL}}{10 \cancel{\text{ mg}}} = 3.75 \text{ mL}\]
    
    Round to nearest tenth: **3.8 mL**

!!! example "Problem 4"

    Stock: 200 mg/5 mL
    How many mL?

??? success "Answer"
    \[\frac{0.6 \cancel{\text{ g}}}{1} \times \frac{1000 \cancel{\text{ mg}}}{1 \cancel{\text{ g}}} \times \frac{5 \text{ mL}}{200 \cancel{\text{ mg}}} = 15 \text{ mL}\]

    How many mL?

??? success "Answer"
    \[\frac{30 \cancel{\text{ mg}}}{1} \times \frac{5 \text{ mL}}{15 \cancel{\text{ mg}}} = 10 \text{ mL}\]

!!! example "Problem 7 — Flag This Answer"
    Order: digoxin 0.5 mg orally
    Stock: 0.05 mg/mL solution
    How many mL?

??? success "Answer"
    \[\frac{0.5 \cancel{\text{ mg}}}{1} \times \frac{1 \text{ mL}}{0.05 \cancel{\text{ mg}}} = 10 \text{ mL}\]
    
    !!! danger "Verify Before Administering"
        10 mL of digoxin is at the upper limit of reasonable. 
        Digoxin is a high alert medication. Independently 
        verify the order, stock concentration, and your 
        calculation with a second nurse before administering.

!!! warning "Clinical Tip"
    When drawing up liquid medications in an oral syringe, 
    always expel any air bubbles and confirm the volume 
    at eye level before administering. A small air bubble 
    can make a 5 mL dose appear to be 6 mL.
