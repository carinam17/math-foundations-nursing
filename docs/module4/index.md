# Module 4 - Dosage Calculations

## Overview

Dosage calculation is the direct application of everything 
covered in Modules 1 through 3. This module focuses on 
calculating the correct amount of medication to administer 
across the most common clinical scenarios.

Every calculation in this module uses **unit cancellation** 
as the primary method. If any step feels unclear, return 
to Module 3 before continuing.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module you should be able to:

- Calculate the correct number of tablets or capsules to administer
- Calculate the correct volume of liquid medication to administer
- Calculate weight-based doses for adult patients
- Calculate weight-based doses for pediatric patients
- Identify and flag unreasonable answers before administering
- Apply the seven rights of medication administration

## Topics

- [Oral Medications](oral-medications.md)
- [Liquid Medications](liquid-medications.md)
- [Weight-Based Dosing](weight-based-dosing.md)
- [Pediatric Dosing](pediatric-dosing.md)

## Estimated Time

Approximately 2-2.5 hours including practice problems.

## The Seven Rights

!!! info "Before Every Medication Administration"
    The Seven Rights are your safety framework for every 
    medication you administer — regardless of how confident 
    you are in your calculation.

    1. **Right Patient** — verify with two identifiers
    2. **Right Medication** — check label three times
    3. **Right Dose** — calculate and verify
    4. **Right Route** — oral, IV, IM, SC, topical
    5. **Right Time** — scheduled, PRN, stat
    6. **Right Documentation** — chart immediately after
    7. **Right Reason** — know why the patient is receiving it

!!! warning "High Alert Medications"
    Some medications require independent double-checking 
    by a second nurse regardless of your confidence in 
    the calculation. Common high alert medications include:

    - Insulin
    - Heparin
    - Warfarin
    - Digoxin
    - Chemotherapy agents
    - Concentrated electrolytes

    Always follow your facility policy on double-checking 
    requirements.

## Connecting Back to Previous Modules

| Skill | Where You Learned It |
|---|---|
| Rounding final answers | Module 1 |
| Converting mg to g, lb to kg | Module 2 |
| Setting up unit cancellation chains | Module 3 |
| Reading stock ratios from labels | Module 3 |
| Reasonableness checks | Module 3 |

!!! tip "Before You Begin"
    Write out every step of every calculation. Do not 
    do mental math for medication calculations — ever. 
    The few seconds saved are never worth the risk.
