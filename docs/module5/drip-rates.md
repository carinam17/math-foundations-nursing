# Drip Rates

## Overview

When an electronic infusion pump is not available, IV fluids 
are administered by gravity using a drip set. In this case 
the flow rate is controlled manually by adjusting a roller 
clamp and counting drops per minute (gtt/min).

## Drop Factor

The drop factor is the number of drops per milliliter 
produced by a specific IV tubing set. It is printed on 
the tubing package and must be verified before calculating.

| Tubing Type | Drop Factor |
|---|---|
| Macrodrip — standard | 10 gtt/mL |
| Macrodrip — standard | 15 gtt/mL |
| Macrodrip — standard | 20 gtt/mL |
| Microdrip | 60 gtt/mL |

!!! info "Which Tubing to Use"
    - **Macrodrip (10-20 gtt/mL)** — standard fluid replacement, 
      blood products, high volume infusions
    - **Microdrip (60 gtt/mL)** — pediatric patients, precise 
      low-volume infusions, critical medications

## The Drip Rate Formula

\[\text{Drip Rate (gtt/min)} = \frac{\text{Volume (mL)}}{\text{Time (min)}} \times \text{Drop Factor (gtt/mL)}\]

Or using an hourly rate:

\[\text{Drip Rate (gtt/min)} = \frac{\text{Rate (mL/hr)} \times \text{Drop Factor (gtt/mL)}}{60 \text{ min/hr}}\]

## Rounding Drip Rates

!!! info "Always Round to Whole Number"
    Drip rates are always rounded to the nearest 
    **whole number** — you cannot count a fraction 
    of a drop.

## Calculations from Volume and Time

**Example 1:**
Order: 1000 mL over 8 hours
Tubing: 20 gtt/mL
What is the drip rate in gtt/min?

Convert time to minutes:
\[8 \text{ hr} \times 60 \text{ min/hr} = 480 \text{ min}\]

Calculate drip rate:
\[\frac{1000 \text{ mL}}{480 \text{ min}} \times 20 \text{ gtt/mL} = 41.7 \text{ gtt/min}\]

Round to: **42 gtt/min**

**Example 2:**
Order: 500 mL over 4 hours
Tubing: 15 gtt/mL

\[4 \text{ hr} \times 60 = 240 \text{ min}\]

\[\frac{500 \text{ mL}}{240 \text{ min}} \times 15 \text{ gtt/mL} = 31.25 \text{ gtt/min}\]

Round to: **31 gtt/min**

## Calculations from Hourly Rate

**Example 3:**
Rate: 125 mL/hr
Tubing: 20 gtt/mL

\[\frac{125 \text{ mL/hr} \times 20 \text{ gtt/mL}}{60 \text{ min/hr}} = \frac{2500}{60} = 41.7 \text{ gtt/min}\]

Round to: **42 gtt/min**

**Example 4:**
Rate: 50 mL/hr
Tubing: 60 gtt/mL (microdrip)

\[\frac{50 \text{ mL/hr} \times 60 \text{ gtt/mL}}{60 \text{ min/hr}} = \frac{3000}{60} = 50 \text{ gtt/min}\]

!!! tip "Microdrip Shortcut"
    With microdrip tubing (60 gtt/mL) the drip rate 
    in gtt/min always equals the flow rate in mL/hr.
    
    \[\frac{\text{mL/hr} \times 60}{60} = \text{mL/hr}\]
    
    50 mL/hr with microdrip = **50 gtt/min** always.

## Counting Drops

!!! info "How to Count Drip Rate"
    1. Use a watch with a second hand or timer
    2. Count drops falling in the drip chamber for 
       **60 seconds** for most accurate count
    3. Alternatively count for **15 seconds** and 
       multiply by 4, or **30 seconds** and multiply by 2
    4. Adjust the roller clamp to increase or decrease 
       the rate
    5. Recount after each adjustment
    6. Recheck every 30-60 minutes as gravity rates 
       can drift

## Factors Affecting Gravity Drip Rates

!!! warning "Gravity Drip Rates Are Unreliable"
    Gravity drip rates can be affected by:
    
    - Patient position and arm movement
    - Height of the IV bag above the patient
    - Tubing kinks or partial occlusions
    - Vein pressure changes
    
    For this reason electronic pumps are preferred 
    whenever precision is required. Gravity sets are 
    used when pumps are unavailable or for simple 
    fluid replacement in stable patients.

!!! warning "Clinical Tip"
    Always label the IV bag with the start time and 
    expected completion time. Mark the bag with 
    hourly volume checkpoints so you can verify 
    the infusion is running on schedule at a glance 
    without recalculating every time.
