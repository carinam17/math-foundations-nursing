# Module 5 - IV Flow Rate Calculations

## Overview

Intravenous (IV) therapy delivers fluids, electrolytes, 
and medications directly into the bloodstream. Find both the volume and drip rate for IV administration .

This module builds directly on the unit cancellation 
method from Module 3 and the dosage calculation skills 
from Module 4.

## What you'll learn

By the end of this module you should be able to:

- Calculate IV flow rates in mL/hr for pump programming
- Calculate infusion time for a given volume and rate
- Calculate drip rates in drops per minute (gtt/min) 
  for gravity infusions
- Calculate flow rates for continuous IV medication infusions
- Verify doses from running infusion rates
- Identify and respond to unreasonable pump settings

## Topics

| Topic | Key Skills |
|---|---|
| [IV Flow Rates](iv-flow-rates.md) | mL/hr calculations, time conversion, pump programming |
| [Infusion Time](infusion-time.md) | Duration, completion time, rate adjustments |
| [Drip Rates](drip-rates.md) | gtt/min, drop factors, microdrip shortcut |
| [IV Medications](iv-medications.md) | Concentration, dose rates, weight-based infusions |

## Estimated Time

Approximately 2-2.5 hours including practice problems.

## Clinical Relevance

!!! danger "IV Errors Are Immediately Dangerous"
    Unlike oral medications which are absorbed gradually, 
    IV medications enter the bloodstream instantly. 
    There is no opportunity to reverse an error once 
    an infusion has begun.
    
    Always double check IV calculations. Always verify 
    pump settings. Always know the signs of IV 
    complications — infiltration, phlebitis, and 
    extravasation.

!!! info "Equipment You Will Use"
    | Equipment | Purpose |
    |---|---|
    | IV infusion pump | Precise rate control in mL/hr |
    | Macrodrip set (10-20 gtt/mL) | Standard gravity infusions |
    | Microdrip set (60 gtt/mL) | Precise low-volume infusions |
    | Burette | Pediatric and critical care dosing |

!!! tip "Before You Begin"
    Make sure you are comfortable with unit cancellation 
    from Module 3. Every calculation in this module 
    is a unit cancellation chain — time, volume, 
    concentration, and rate all need to cancel cleanly 
    to the unit you want.
    
    If any setup feels unclear, return to 
    [Unit Cancellation](../module3/unit-cancellation.md) 
    before continuing.
